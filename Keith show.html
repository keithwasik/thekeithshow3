 <h2>THE BLOODY WAR</h2>
  <p>This movie starring <i>Keith</i> opens with a scene of high tension that soon situates the viewer exactly where he or she would never want to be.
    In Afghanistan, a group of peacekeepers is scouring a patch of barren land, walking in a narrow, evenly-spaced line. 
    The better not to get blown up by a land mine. Their work is methodical. The soldiers are in constant contact with their base
    and its commanders and intel officers are providing calm, expert guidance. But of course something bad is going to happen. 
    And something bad does happen, and the consequences weigh heavily on the commanding officer, Claus Pedersen. 
     Out of a sense of guilt, and more overtly to make up for the absence of a shell-shocked soldier whom he’s decided to put on camp 
     patrol, Pedersen begins accompanying his troops on their away-from-base rounds. He doesn’t know it, but he’s setting himself up for a fall.
